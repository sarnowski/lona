[build]
# Use the custom seL4 target by default for the runtime
# Can be overridden with --target flag
# target = "support/targets/aarch64-sel4.json"

# Note: No -nostartfiles flag needed for aarch64-sel4 target.
# rust-lld doesn't include C runtime startup files for bare-metal targets,
# unlike GCC which requires -nostartfiles to disable them.

[env]
# These can be overridden by environment variables
# SEL4_PREFIX is set in the Docker container
